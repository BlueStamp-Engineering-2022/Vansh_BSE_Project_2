# Voice Controlled Robotic Arm
Ever needed an extra hand to do something? Or maybe you are bored and you just want to play a game with someone. Well I have made a voice controlled robotic arm, an arm that can do many things including playing rock-paper-scissors and many hand signals.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
In my first milestone, I connected the Raspberry Pi 4 to the Arduino Uno. I also connected the Arduino Uno to five different servos. These servos will pull strings that will move the fingers for my robotic arm. I have also 3D printed out three fingers to test out my code. These are just prototypes and will not be used in the final model. I wrote a program that detects a mouth. After detecting the mouth, using serial communication, the Raspberry Pi sends a letter through the serial. The Arduino then reads that letter and runs the corresponding function. In this case, it was 'grab'.
